If you're not new to this and just want to help out then your expertise would be greatly appreacited, I am rather new to creating/magaing open source projects and would love some adivce, [here is your discord invite](https://discord.gg/czZTbNs). 

### Things To Do

I've made a list of suggestions incase you're wondering what to do:

* Add more apps - Checkout [this helpful tutorial](https://medium.com/@jamesergray/adding-interactive-iphone-app-5d85a90247c1) 
* Create an intro overlay - Let me know on the discord if you want to work on this, I have some ideas.
* Adding tests If anyone has good testing principles and an idea of how to test the project I would love to learn from you, hit me up on discord.
* Making the iPhone scale based on viewport width - I feel like I'm just being lazy with this one but it should be done.
* Fixing grammar and/or spelling errors anywhere in the docs - This would be greatly appreciated, spelling and grammar have never been a strength of mine. 
* Anything else you think could be improved, please feel free to improve it.
