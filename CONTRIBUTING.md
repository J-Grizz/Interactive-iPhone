## Thank you for considering a contribution!

If you're new to this and you've made it this far then congratulations, I'm excited to start working with you. If you have any questions, suggestions, input, ideas, or just want to say 'hi' then please join the Interactive-iPhone discord server and feel free to @ me, [here is your invite](https://discord.gg/czZTbNs). 

### Things To Do.

I've made a basic list of suggestions for things you might want to work on:

* Add more apps - Tutorial coming soon.
* Create an intro overlay - Let me know on the discord if you want to work on this, I have some ideas.
* Adding tests If anyone has good testing principles and an idea of how to test the project I would love to learn from you, hit me up on discord.
* Making the iPhone scale based on viewport width - I feel like I'm just being lazy with this one but it should be done.
* Fixing grammar and/or spelling errors anywhere in the docs - This would be greatly appreciated, spelling and grammar have never been a strength of mine. 
* Anything else you think could be improved, please feel free to improve it.
