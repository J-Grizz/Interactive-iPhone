#iPhone-Interactive
A simple layout today, a functional phone tomorrow.

This is a project designed to show off my skills and understanding with the core fundamentals of front-end web development.

The idea behind this project was that I did'nt want to have many small applications on my portfolio so I though of a method to display a wider varienty of applications and undestanding within a single application, and thus the idea of the interactive-iPhone was born.
