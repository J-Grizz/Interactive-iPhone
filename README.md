# iPhone-Interactive - An opportunity to learn.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5e01f4cd-5e7c-49cb-af29-611c74fb4044/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/interactive-iphone/deploys)

[Working Demo](https://interactive-iphone.netlify.com/)

Built entirely with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` and bundled with `Webpack`.

##### This project began as a means for me to:

1. Practice doing something unique with the skills I learnt from the front-end section of Colt Steeles [Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
2. Solve the issue of displaying many small projects on my portfolio
3. Practice implementing other applicable skills I learnt along the line, ie., integrating more complex apps and bundling with webpack

##### It is now my hope that other starting out developers will find this project as:

1. A means to get practice with reading code and understanding someone else's code (My code isn't perfect but I've done my best)
2. An opportunity to have a safe space in which to get used to the concepts of contributing to open-source projects
3. Inspiration to hopefully create your own unique app and add it to the iPhone

##### In order to partake you will need to have:

1. A node dev environment set-up, here is a guide if you need to do that
* [Node dev env guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment) 
2. A basic understanding of Git and GitHub, these tutorials by Colt Steele will sort you out in no time
* [Learn Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) 
* [Learn Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s)
3. An understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Dom manipulation), seriously, just go look into the `src` directory and you should notice a familiar file structure, no need to worry about all the scary config files, they work in the background.

4. A willingness to participate, unfortunately, I don't have a guide for this, you either are or you aren't and it's fine either way, but I'd much prefer it if you were.
 
## Installing Locally

First, you will want to get a copy of the repository in your local file system. You can do this by clicking on the green `Clone or Download` button in the top right corner of the repository and then either downloading it as zip folder or copying the URL and using the command:
```
git clone <repository url>
```
to create a copy of the repository in whichever directory the command was run from.

Next, you will want to navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <path to directory>
```
and then run 
```
npm i
```
to install all dependencies and boom, its all set-up. The only thing left to do is to start the program which can be done by 
running:
```
npm start
```
that should open a new tab in your browser where you will see the development build of the interactive-iPhone. Thanks to webpack magic any changes you make to the code will automatically sync with the browser, so now you're all ready to start playing around.
